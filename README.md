# Neural Tangent Kernel for `scikit-learn` Gaussian Processes

**scikit-ntk** is implementation of the neural tangent kernel (NTK) for the `scikit-learn` machine learning library.  This library is meant to directly integrate with [`sklearn.gaussian_process`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.gaussian_process) module.  This implementation of the NTK can be used in combination with other kernels to train and predict with Gaussian process regressors and classifiers.
